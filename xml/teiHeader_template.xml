<head>Introduction</head>

<div n="aim">
<head>Aim of this edition</head>
<p>The present edition aims at providing a better text
	of the <title>Chronicon</title> by Romualdus Salernitanus
	through a new collation of the text of the print editions
	by Garufi 1914 and Bonetti 2001 against A and O,
	the main witnesses of the 'short version' of the work.</p>
</div>


<div n="chronicon">
<head>The Chronicon</head>
<p>The <title>Chronicon</title> is a universal history, believed to have been
	composed by the Archbishop of Salerno Romualdus II Guarna shortly before
	his death (1181). For the period going from Adam until 1125, Romualdus
	followed previous sources, possibly working on a previous compilation 
	(see paragraph 'Authenticity' below), while for contemporary events
	his work is a primary source.</p>
<p>In particular, Romualdus was one of the protagonists of the
	"Peace of Venice" (1177), a treaty between Emperor Frederick I, Pope
	Alexander III and other political entities of the Italian area,
	covered in great detail in the last part of the <title>Chronicon</title>.
	In fact, Romualdus was a leading figure of the delegation sent by King 
	William II of Sicily to the negotiations in Venice.</p>
</div>


<div n="manuscripts">
<head>Manuscripts</head>
<p>The three oldest witnesses of the work are:
<list>
	<item>A: Vaticanus Latinus 3973, of the late XII century; available in
		<ref type="url" target="https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Vat.lat.3973">

	</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Another interesting witness is
<list>
	<item>O: a fragment of MS Ottobonianus Latinus 2940,
		(XIV century), namely folios 16r-18v, available in
		<ref type="url" target="https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Ott.lat.2940">
			https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Ott.lat.2940</ref>;
		III manifest in
		<ref type="IIIF" target="https://digi.vatlib.it/iiif/MSS_Ott.lat.2940/manifest.json">
			https://digi.vatlib.it/iiif/MSS_Ott.lat.2940/manifest.json</ref>.
	</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The specific interest of O lies in the fact that, as argued by
	Schwarz 1978, 139 n. 119, it might have been copied from a lost MS,
	older than A (also see Matthews 1981, 250 n. 1; Zabbia 2004, 387,
	endnotes 26, 27 and 29; Zabbia 2006, 62.</p>
<p>The siglum used by Garufi 1914, Schwarz 1978 and other scholars for
	this manuscript is 'Aa'. I am modifying it to 'O' for
	consistency with the other sigla (one letter only, not
	including character 'A' already used for Vat. Lat. 3973),
	thus facilitating the processing of XML files.</p>
<p>A detailed description and discussion of the manuscript tradition can be found in
	Garufi 1914, XXXI-XXXVI; Hoffmann 1967, 156-165 (mostly on MS A);
	Matthew 1981, 241-242; Zabbia 2004, 385-388;
	Zabbia 2006 and Zabbia 2010, 24-25.</p>
</div>


<div n="print">
<head>Print editions and translations</head>
<p>The two most recent print editions of the <title>Chronicon</title> are
	Garufi 1914 (henceforth "Garufi"; see Erdmann 1930 for a review)
	and Bonetti 2001 (henceforth "Bonetti"). The latter starts with
	paragraph g163.6-163.7 and includes an Italian translation.</p>
<p>Bonetti uses Garufi as "testo base" and Arndt 1866 as "elemento
	integrativo" (see 'Nota al testo', Bonetti, 56), so, although
	the book has been published in 2001, its Latin text is taken
	from editions no longer covered by copright.</p>
<p>Previously, the <title>Chronicon</title> had been published by Muratori 1725;
	Del Re 1875 (from paragraph g212.1-212.4, with Italian
	translation); Arndt 1866 (from g163.11-164.9).
	Schmale 1986, 308-371 publishes the section on the Peace of
	Venice, based on Garufi's text, with a German translation.
	Carucci 1996 is an Italian translation of selected passages
	of the same section.
	Loud 2012, 250-268 provides an English translation covering
	years 1125-1154.
	See Garufi, XXVIII-XXXI for previous print editions and
	<ref type="url" target="http://www.geschichtsquellen.de/werk/4214">
		http://www.geschichtsquellen.de/werk/4214</ref>
	for other translations and general bibliography
	on the <title>Chronicon</title>.</p>
<p>Bibliographical details on the editions by Bonetti and Garufi
	are in the 'sourceDesc' element of this TEI XML file;
	on the other works cited, in the
	bibliography at the end of this introduction.</p>
</div>


<div n="xmlid">
<head>Paragraph identifiers</head>
<p>Paragraphs ('p' elements in the TEI XML source) have been labelled
	with @xml:id attributes based on Garufi. For instance, paragraph
	'g163.1-163.5' goes from page 163, line 1 to page 163, line 5 of
	the Garufi edition. In some cases, Garufi's paragraphs have been
	further broken into smaller 'p' elements to facilitate collation.
	In these cases, the @xml:id still reflects the extent of the
	textual portion in the Garufi edition.</p>
</div>


<div n="sigla">
<head>Sigla</head>
<p>As noted in the 'sourceDesc' element,
	in the @wit attributes of 'lem' and 'rdg'
	elements I used abbreviations 'g' for Garufi, 'b' for Bonetti,
	'a' for MS A (first hand), 'a2' for the second hand of MS A
	(probably XVII century) and 'o' for the fragment of MS O.</p>
</div>


<div n="structure">
<head>Structure of the work</head>
<list>
	<item>Universal history:
		the <title>Chronicon</title> initially follows ancient Jewish,
		Greek and and Roman history, then European (continental and
		Byzantine) events.</item>
	<item>Digression on Lombards and Franks:
		from paragraph g108.24-109.5 (i.e. page 108 of Garufi's
		edition, line 24) to par. g159.9-159.25, the text includes
		a long digression on the the history of the Lombards and the
		Franks until Louis the Pious.</item>
	<item>Southern Italian section:
		Then, the scope of the narrative returns to be wide, continental,
		but it progressively focusses on Southern Italy, until it
		substantially becomes a chronicle of the Norman conquest of this
		geographical area.
		The initial part of this section (roughly years 999-1125)
		is centered on peninsular Southern Italy
		(see Zabbia 2010, 25-42).
	</item>
	<item>Sicilian section:
		the second part of the 'Norman' section (from year 1125
		to the Peace of Venice) is centered on Palermo and Sicily
		(see Zabbia 2010, 42-60.</item>
	<item>Peace of Venice:
		the work, as mentioned above, ends with the detailed account
		of the Peace of Venice (from par. v-b298a of the present edition
		to the end of the work).</item>
</list>
</div>

<div n="sources">
<head>Sources</head>
<p>Garufi 1914 has a very informative separate apparatus
	of footnotes identifying the sources of each passage of the work.
	Detailed information and critical discussion on the sources
	of Romualdus and his relationship with Norman historiography are in
	Arndt 1866 (running footnotes); Garufi, XXV-XXVIII (introduction);
	Hoffmann 1967, 165-170; Matthew 1981, 243-249; 258-267;
	Zabbia 2002; Zabbia 2004, 380-382 and 392-394;
	Zabbia 2010, 22 and 25-60.</p>
<list>
	<item>The main source for the first part of the work
		(the universal history) is
		Beda, <title>De sex aetatibus mundi</title>,
		integrated mostly with the Bible;
		Eutropius, <title>Breviarium ab urbe condita</title>;
		Orosius, <title>Historia adversum paganos</title>; 
		Paulus Diaconus, <title>Historia Romana</title>;
		Hieronymus (Saint Jerome), <title>Chronicon</title>
		and <title>Commentary on Daniel</title>;
		the <title>Liber Pontificalis</title> and
		Bonizo of Sutri (see Matthew 1981, 245 n. 2).
	</item>
	<item>For the digression on Franks and Lombards, the main sources are
		Paulus Diaconus, <title>Historia Langobardorum</title>
		possibly with the related <title>Continuatio Casinensis</title>;
		Gregorius Turonensis (Gregory of Tours),
		<title>Historia Francorum</title>;
		Einhardus (Einhard), <title>Vita Karoli</title>;
		Aimoinus Floriacensis (Aimoin of Fleury),
		<title>Historia Francorum</title>
		and his continuation (see Matthew 1981, 245 n. 3).
	</item>
	<item>The question of the sources of the <title>Chronicon</title>
		for the Norman period (roughly after 999)
		is intertwined with the authorship issue, on which see
		the next paragraphs and the bibliography cited above on sources.
		Anyway, a key source for this period are the <title>Annales</title>
		by Lupus Protospatharius.</item>

<div n="authorship-evidence">
<head>Authorship: textual evidence</head>
<p>It is not the task of this introduction to examine in depth the
	question of the authorship of the <title>Chronicon</title>.
	However, I will shortly summarize the issue. The attribution
	of the work to Romualdus Salernitanus originates from
	two textual notes in the handwritten tradition:</p>
<list>
	<item>Note A:
		a sentence in MS C, not present in the other main manuscripts,
		probably originating from a a marginal note: "Ab hoc loco
		adiunctum est huic chronice per Romualdum secundum Salernatanum

<div n="authorship-hypotheses">
<head>Authorship: hypotheses</head>
<p>For Matthew 1981, note A only proves that the scribe who wrote it believed
	in Romualdus' authorship, and the second that the report of the
	Peace of Venice was based on the archbishop's, possibly written, testimony.
	Mattews discusses numerous arguments in favor of the thesis that
	the author of the <title>Chronicon</title> is not Romualdus:
	he suggests that around 1126 an anonymous compiler based in the
	Apulian city of Troia wrote a compilation of universal history reporting
	events until 1125 (see Matthew 1981, 239-256);
	later, "a writer from Salerno decided to set down the events of the
	reigns to Roger II and the two Williams in 1177",
	while only the report of the Peace of Venice "is taken from
	the written, eyewitness, and true account of Archbishop Romuald"
	(Matthew 1981, 269-270). Vitolo 2007, 549-551 follows Matthew,
	and highlights the lack of attention to the famous medical school
	of Salerno (except for a short note in g189.2-189.5).
	For Oldoni (2001 and 2004), the text until year 893 may have been
	written by Romualdus; the section on years 893-1127 shows "una scrittura
	a più mani ove intervengono, con Romualdo, almeno altri due scribi"; 
	years 1127-1173 were entrusted to Romualdus' collaborators; finally,
	only the section after 1173 was "forse [l]'unica parte certamente 
	originale dell'opera sua".</p>
<p>Zabbia 2004 confutes Mattew's arguments and suggests
	that Romualdus is the author of the whole work, though he does not
	rule out the possibility, based on note A, that the archbishop
	continued a previously existing universal chronicle.
	In his view, note A simply suggests that "sino al 1125 l'arcivescovo
	avrebbe condotto il suo lavoro sulle fonti; dopo quella data
	– a partire cioè da quando Romualdo aveva all'incirca quindici anni –
	il racconto sarebbe fondato sulla memoria dell'autore"
	(also see Pio 1996, 26 n. 26), though he adds:
	"Tutto ciò non consente di escludere che l'arcivescovo potesse disporre
	di una cronaca in cui almeno parte del materiale fosse già organizzata"
	(Zabbia 2004, 389 and 392, where he hypothesizes the existence of a
	previous "codice miscellaneo" as source of Romualdus).
	In a later essay (Zabbia 2010), the same scholar proposes a theory
	closer to one of Matthew's: for the period between 999
	(the arrival of Normans to Southern Italy) to 1125, the source of Romualdus
	was a pre-existing short chronicle, written in Salerno within the first
	fourth of the XII century. For Zabbia, this short chronicle was the common
	source of Romualdus' <title>Chronicon</title> for this period and of the
	<title>Chronicon Amalphitanum</title> (Zabbia 2010, 25-42), however a
	comparison between the two works shows that Romualdus did not simply copy
	from his source, but integrated it with other information, for example
	on the papacy. See Zabbia 2004, 384 and Zabbia 2010, 21-24
	for further bibliography on the authorship issue.</p>
<p>Zabbia's arguments on the authorship of the <title>Chronicon</title>
	balance out those of Matthew. This leaves the question open, at least
	for the part of the work before year 1125.
	While evidence is not conclusive, notes A and B suggest quite clearly
	at least that:</p>
<list>
	<item>The final part of the work – the account of the Peace of Venice –
		was almost certainly either written by Romualdus himself,
		or under his supervision (see note B);</item>
	<item>the section from year 1125 (par. g213.1-213.8) to the Peace of Venice
		was "adiunctum" by Romualdus as well (note A);</item>
	<item>the section from Adam to year 1125 originated from something
		that existed before Romualdus (note A again: "adiunctum est
		huic chronice").</item>
</list>
<p>The hypothesis proposed by Zabbia 2010 essay is economic and entirely consistent
	with this evidence. If Romualdus mixed and summarized different sources
	(directly or supervising the work of his collaborators) for the universal
	history and the digression on Lombards and Franks until 999, and hence
	mostly followed and integrated the short chronicle postulated by Zabbia
	until 1125, then a scribe could reasonably write in note A that only
	from that point on ("ab hoc loco") Romualdus added up new information
	to the <title>Chronicon</title>.</p>

<div n="long">
<head>Long and short versions of the work</head>
<p>Manuscripts B and C present a number of textual passages absent in A and O.
	We thus distinguish between a 'long' (MSS B and C)
	and 'short' version of the work (A and O). Those additions
	correspond to the following paragraphs in the present edition:
	g3.7-3.16, g10.n2-10.n5, g30.n1-30.n3, g179.10-179.11, g186.6-186.7,

	g219.n1-219.n13, g217.n10-218.n16, g234.n1-236.n10.</p>
<p>In this XML file, the 'p' elements including these additions have been
	marked with attribute @decls="#longversion", linking to the relevant
	'editorialDecl' in the TEI header.</p>
<p>Scholars are unanimously convinced that these are later additions to the
	'short' version' (see Garufi, XXXIV; Matthew 1981, 241-243,
	Zabbia 2004, 386-387; Zabbia 2006, 59-61 and Zabbia 2010, 24-25, 27
	and 43-49), but Garufi himself includes some of them in his text.
	He therefore seem to imply (like Palumbo 1978, 76-78) that Romualdus
	himself was the author of those specific additions. Zabbia 2006, 60
	suggests that the first ones (g3.7-3.16, g10.n2-10.n5, g30.n1-30.n3)
	might actually be authorial, and therefore constitute lacunae in A,
	rather than later additions in B and C.</p>
<p>Zabbia maintains that all additions are generally consistent with
	the style of the whole <title>Chronicon</title>, that they have been
	written shortly after the composition of the whole work (Zabbia 2004, 397:
	"interventi databili a ridosso della stesura"), and that it is not impossible
	that Romualdus himself (Zabbia 2006, 60) or "uno dei suoi collaboratori
	(Zabbia 2010, 25) added them to the <title>Chronicon</title>.</p>

<p>In the part of the text collated against Bonetti (g163.1-163.5 to the end),

	(<ref type="url"

		Variance Viewer</ref>
	is a partial exception, as it only takes @rend attributes into account;

	TEI transcriptions to prepare them for collation with juxtacommons.org.
	I 'normalized' transcriptions (i.e. removed transcribed information from them)
	through custom Python scripts, which:</p>
<list>
	<item>extracted an 'alphabetic' transcription from those
		paragraphs that had been transcribed 
		at the graphematic layer;</item>
	<item>deleted the following tags with their textual content:
		'abbr', 'interp', 'milestone', 'note', 'surplus';</item>
	<item>normalized numerals, e.g. 'xiiii' from MS A to 'XIV';</item>
	<item>replaced gaps in the MSS with placeholder text, e.g.
		{Gap in the MS: 1 illegible word};</item>
	<item>chose between 'sic'/'corr', 'reg'/'orig' elements;</item>
	<item>in particular, regularized 'j' to 'i' and 'v' to 'u'
		in all print and handwritten sources;</item>
	<item>capitalized proper nouns and words at the beginning
		of sentences (e.g. 'pompeius' from MS A to 'Pompeius');</item>
	<item>stripped the markup for the following TEI tags
		(keeping their textual content, if any):
		'add', 'choice', 'del', 'expan', 'gap', 'hi', 'l',
		'lb', 'num', 'orig', 'pb', 'quote', 'reg', 's', 'said',
		'seg', 'sic', 'soCalled', 'subst', 'supplied', 'surplus',
		'title', 'w';</item>
	<item>replaced XML angle brackets with [square brackets]
		for 'p' start- and end-tags, thus producing an output

<head>Variants for which many subtypes apply</head>
<p>For some variants (i.e. for some 'app' elements), it is impossible

<list>
	<item>either because two subtypes apply: e.g., for
		Symmachus/Simachus, both 'y' and 'double'

	<item>or because there are three readings with different
		types and/or subtypes: e.g.
		Pisa (in Bonetti) / Pysas (in MS A) / Pisas (in MS O).
		In this case, Pisa/Pysas is a 'substantive' variant
		(change in case and number), but Pysas/Pisas
		is an 'orthographic'/'y' variant).</item>
</list>
<p>As far as the fist issue is concerned,
	I took the oversimplifying (and certainly questionable)
	approach of choosing what I thought was the most relevant
	type/subtype: for example, I chose subtype 'y' for
	Symmachus/Simachus and type 'substantive'
	for Pisa/Pysas/Pisas.</p>
<p>As to the second issue, in fact a 'variant' is such only
	in relationship with a specific other reading (in the TEI
	guidelines, in relationship with the lemma). Therefore the
	@type and @subtype attributes should rather be attributed
	to each 'rdg' element, not to the whole 'app' element'.</p>
<p>However, since almost all 'app's only include two readings,
	for practical reasons I decided to dive @type and @subtype
	to the whole 'app' and add
	@subtype="3elements3variants" or
	@subtype="3elements3variants_bonetti_and_garufi"
	to those 'app's to signal that we are in a peculiar case.</p>
</div>


<div n="substantive-orthographic">
<head>Distinction between substantive and orthographic</head>
<p>Also, the line between 'substantive' and 'orthographic' variants
	is thin, somewhat arbitrary and conceptually complex.
	This is particularly evident for proper nouns, for which the
	change or reduplication of one letter can be considered meaningful.
	This is why for proper nouns I tended to choose @type='substantive'
	except for the most common orthographic subtypes, such as 'double'
	(Callixtus/Calixtus), 'y' (Babyloniam/Babiloniam)
	or 'h' (Hieronymo/Ieronimo).</p>
</div>


<div n="case-variants">
<head>Case variants</head>
<p>Some 'app' elements mark a distinction between
	the lowercase and capitalized spelling of the same
	word: these elements have @type="orthographic" with
	@subtype="case". For example, 'Cainan' (my lemma) vs 'cainan'
	(reading of Garufi and in my TEI XML transcription of MS A).</p>
<p>In my transcriptions MSS will always have the lowercase spelling
	by convention, because capitalization does not have graphematic
	value in them.</p>
<p>Therefore, those 'app' elements simply signal that I capitalize a word
	that was in lowercase in the print edition, or vice versa.</p>

<div n="punctuation-variants">
<head>Punctuation variants</head>
<p>The case of punctuation is similar to the preceding one.
I chose not to transcribe the MSS punctuation, so all 'app'
elements with type="punctuation" mean that I am modifying
the punctuation of the print edition (of the collation exemplar
for that part of the text). For example, I deleted all
quotation marks from the Bonetti edition, but sometimes
punctuation modification implies significant differences
in phrase and sentence segmentation, therefore in syntax
and text interpretation.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Orthographic variants</head>
<p>In orthographic variants
(i.e. 'app' elements with type="orthographic"), I generally tended
not to modify the print edition spelling. I did modify it,
mostly by adopting MS A's spelling, in cases in which 
<list>
	<item>the print edition has an evident typo, which the MS
		does not have (e.g. 'eorem' Garufi / 'eorum MS A
		in g26.12-26.23);</item>
	<item>the MS's form clearly is more standard both in classical 
		dieval Latin and, most of all, more adherent
		to the usus scribendi of the rest of the work
		(e.g. 'espers' in Garufi / 'expers' in A,
		or omicidia G / homicidia A);</item>
	<item>the print edition has a classical diphthong ('ae' or 'oe')
		while the MS has the monophthongized spelling, which
		I preferred, since monophthongized forms are standard
		in the text. For example, in g70.1-70.19 I chose
		A's 'Rome' over Garufi's 'Romae'. This is a sub-case
		of the previous principle, and in 'ae'/'e' variants
		it is marked with @subtype='ae';</item>
	<item>I eliminated a dash distinguishing a composed word
		in the print edition (e.g. in g80.1-80.4 I chose spelling
		'Primiscrinium' over 'Primi-scrinium' of Garufi).</item>

<div>
<head>Factual variants</head>

<p>The aim of this edition is
	to publish a text as close as possible
	to what has been written by Romualdus or his collaborators,
	not to what has actually happened in history, so I did not
	correct fact, names or dates. Besides, such a task would have
	required a historic competence that is beyond my skills.
	The footnotes in the Garufi edition and the essays cited
	in this introduction provide rich critical discussions
	on this matter.</p>

<p>Dates in particular are an aspect in which the <title>Chronicon</title> is often
	imprecise and there is great variability among the witnesses:
	when dates in A or O diverged from those in Garufi and Bonetti,
	I systematically adhered to the print editions.</p>
</div>


<div n="statistics">

<div>
<head>The text before and after the author</head>

<p>There are passages in which Romualdus follows a source very closely,
	but skips some words. In some of these passages, Garufi
	integrates the missing words.
	For instance, in g100.6-103.2 the <title>Chronicon</title>
	copies Paulus Diaconus, <title>Hist. Rom.</title> 14.116
	"adest Geisericus cum ualidissimo suae gentis exercitu",
	but skips the words "suae gentis", which are found in no MS
	of the <title>Chronicon</title>.
	In these cases I reject Garufi's integrations based on
	the principle of considering the <title>Chronicon</title>
	an autonomous text, rather than a copy of his sources.</p>

<p>These cases, together with complex philological issues such as
	the attitions differentiating the 'long' and 'short' version
	of the <title>Chronicon</title>, raise interesting, very
	general questions on the work of the philologist.
	The text of Paulus Diaconus came 'before' Romualdus and his
	(possible) collaborators, while that of the additions
	probably arose 'after' him (or them).
       	Where is the 'original text' that the philologist approximates?</p>

<p>The 'original text', especially in cases of a complex editorial work such
	as the <title>Chronicon</title>, looks as elusive as the elusive notion
	of 'present', at the sliding edge between past and future.</p>

<p>These issues become more evident to us as we get closer to the author.
	Mordenti 2001, par. 9.1 discusses the extreme case
	of transcription and raises "[la] domanda fondamentale della filologia
	[...] quella che riguarda il concetto di testo e, in particolare,
	di testo originale" and quotes D'Arco Silvio Avalle and Cesare Segre:
	"Il concetto di originale, nel senso di testo autentico esprimente
	la volontà dell'autore, è uno dei più sfuggenti ed ambigui della
	critica del testo. [...] le singole opere di uno scrittore costituiscono
	a rigore una sezione a volte casuale e provvisoria – e non sempre
	operata dall'autore stesso [...] di quel flusso continuo di adattamenti
	e di spostamenti successivi attraverso cui si esprimono le tendenze
	fondamentali di un sistema letterario" (Avalle 1972, 32-33); and
	"Ogni testo scritto è in realtà trascritto: da un copista, da un tipografo.
	Anche l'autografo è una trascrizione (dalla brutta copia); e la brutta copia
	costituisce di norma un testo non definitivo. Insomma, ogni trascrizione è
	anteriore o posteriore al testo; nessun testo può essere identificato col Testo"
	Segre 1979, 36.</p>
