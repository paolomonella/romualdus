<div>
<head>The Chronicon</head>
<p>The Chronicon is a universal history composed by Archbishop of Salerno
	Romualdus II Guarna shortly before his death (1181). For the
	period going from Adam until 1125, Romualdus compiled previous sources,
	possibly working on a previous compilation (see paragraph 'Authenticity' below),
	while for contemporary events his work is a first hand source.
	In particular, Romualdus was one of the protagonists of the
	"Peace of Venice" (1177), a treaty between Emperor Frederick I, Pope
	Alexander III and other political entities of the Italian area,
	covered in great detail in the last part of the Chronicon.
	In fact, Romualdus was a leading figure of the delegation sent by King 
	William II of Sicily to the negotiations in Venice.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Structure of the work</head>
<p> The Chronicon initially follows ancient Jewish, Greek and and Roman
	ancient history, then European (continental and Byzantine) events.
	It then includes a digression on the the story of the Lombards and the Franks
	until Louis the Pious 
	(from paragraph g108.24-109.5 i.e. page 108 of Garufi's edition, line 24,
	to par. g159.9-159.25). From this point on, the scope of the narrative
	returns to be wide, continental, but it progressively focusses on Southern
	Italy, until it substantially becomes a chronicle of its Norman conquest and then
	of the Kingdom of Sicily, ending with the detailed account of the Peace of Venice
	(from par. v-b298a of the present edition to the end of the work).
	On the structure and the sources of the work, see Zabbia 2004, 380-383.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Authorship: textual evidence</head>
<p>It is not the task of this introduction to examine in depth the question of the
	authorship of the Chronicon. However, I will shortly summarize the issue.
	The attribution of the work to Romualdus Salernitanus is based on two textual
	notes in the handwritten tradition:
<list>
	<item>a sentence in manuscript C (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Latinus 4933),
		not present in the other main manuscripts,
		probably a marginal note that later entered the text:
		"Ab hoc loco adiunctum est huic chronice per Romualdum secundum
		Salernatanum archiepiscopum".
		The note (not included in the text of my edition)
		is in par. g213.1-213.8, precisely in page 213, line 5 of Garufi's edition,
		between "...iuramentum accepit" and "Dux autem Wilhelmus..." (events of year 1125).
		Garufi reports the note in apparatus (see Matthew 1981, 255-256
		and Zabbia 2004, 382, 388 and footnote 5);
	</item>
	<item>
		a second sentence in par. g293.39-294.2: "Hec autem omnia, que prediximus,
		ita gesta fuisse, nulli dubitationis uel incredulitatis scrupulum moueant,
		quia Romoaldus secundus Salernitanus archiepiscopus, qui uidit et interfuit,
		scripsit hec; et sciatis, quia uerum est testimonium eius" (see Mattew 1981, 239-240).
	       	With "hec... omnia, que prediximus", the text refers to the Peace of Venice.
	</item>
</list>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Authorship: hypotheses</head>
<p>For Matthew 1981, the first note only proves that
	the scribe who wrote it believed in Romualdus' authorship, and the second
	that the report of the Peace of Venice was based on the archbishop's,
	possibly written, testimony. Mattews discusses numerous arguments in favor
	of the thesis that the author of the Chronicon is not Romualdus:
	he suggests that around 1126 an anonymous compiler based in the
	Apulian city of Troia wrote a compilation of universal history reporting
	events until 1125 (see Matthew 1981, 239-256);
	later, "a writer from Salerno decided to set down the events of the
	reigns to Roger II and the two Williams in 1177",
	while only the report of the Peace of Venice "is taken from
	the written, eitiwness, and true account of Archbishop Romuald"
	(Matthew 1981, 269-270).</p>
<p>Zabbia 2004 confuted Mattew's arguments and suggested,
	that Romualdus is the author of the whole work, though he does not
	rule out the possibility, based on the first note mentioned above
	("Ab hoc loco adiunctum est...', par. g213.1-213.8), that
	the archbishop continued a previously existing universal chronicon.
	In his view, the note "Ab hoc loco..." simply suggests that
	"sino al 1125 l'arcivescono avrebbe condotto il suo lavoro sulle fonti;
	dopo quella data – a partire cioè da quando Romualdo aveva all'incirca
	quindici anni – il racconto sarebbe fondato sulla memoria dell'autore"
	(§ metti qui la pag. di zabbia in cui la dice: mi pare, 389).</p>
<p>Zabbia's arguments on balance out those of Matthew. This leaves the authorship
	question open, at least for the part of the work before year 1125.
	While internal evidence is not conclusive, the two notes mentioned 
	above suggest quite clearly that:
<list>
	<item>The final part of the work – the account of the Peace of Venice –
		was almost certainly either written by Romualdus himself,
		or under his supervision (see second note above);</item>
	<item>the section from year 1125 (par. g213.1-213.8) to the Peace of Venice
		was added, 'adiunctum' by Romualdus as well (see first note);</item>
	<item>the section from Adam to year 1125 constituted something that existed
		before Romualdus (see first note: "adiunctum est huic chronice").</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>For Zabbia, this pre-existing 'chronica' is a collective denomination
	for the sources that Romualdus summarized or copied, though he adds:
	"Tutto ciò non consente di escludere che l'arcivescono potesse disporre
	di una cronaca in cui almeno parte del materiale fosse già organizzata"
	(Zabbia 2004, 389). I incline towards the latter hypothesis, though
	I agree with Zabbia that Romualdus himself probably conducted or coordinated
	the final editorial work on the whole Chronicon.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Manuscripts</head>
<p>The three oldest witnesses of the work are:
<list>
	<item>A: Vaticanus Latinus 3973, available in
		https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Vat.lat.3973;</item>
	<item>B: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Archivio di San Pietro, E 22,
		available in http://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Arch.Cap.S.Pietro.E.22;</item>
	<item>C: Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Latinus 4933; see Zabbia 2004, 385 and 
		https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc63823p).</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Another important witness is:
<list>
	<item>O: a fragment of MS Ottobonianus Latinus 2940,
		folios 16r-18v, available in
		https://digi.vatlib.it/mss/detail/Ott.lat.2940.
	</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>The importance of O lies in the fact that Schwartz [§ add year] argued that
	it might be copied from a lost MS, older than A.</p>

<p>The siglum used by Schwartz and other scholars for it
	is 'Aa'. I am modifying it to 'O' for consistency
	with the other sigla (one letter only, not including
	character 'A' already used for Vat. Lat. 3973), thus
	facilitating the processing of XML files.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Print editions</head>
<p>The two most recent print editions of the Chronicon are Garufi 1914 and
	Bonetti 2001, described in the 'sourceDesc' of this TEI XML file.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Paragraph identifiers</head>
<p>Paragraphs ('p' elements in the TEI XML source) have been labelled
with @xml:id attributes based on Garufi. For instance, paragraph
'g163.1-163.5' goes from page 163, line 1 to page 163, line 5 of
the Garufi edition. In some cases, Garufi's paragraphs have been
further broken into smaller 'p' elements to facilitate collation.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Sigla</head>
<p>As noted in the 'sourceDesc' element,
	in the @wit attributes of 'lem' and 'rdg'
	elements I used sigla 'g' for Garufi', 'b' for Bonetti,
	'a' for MS A (first hand), 'a2' for the second hand of MS A
	(probably XVII century) and 'o' for the fragment of MS O.</p>
</div>

<head>Long and short versions of the work</head>

<p>MSS B and C present a number of textual passages absent in A and O.
	We thus distinguish between a 'long' (MSS B and C)
	and 'short' version of the work (A and O). Those additions
	correspond to paragraphs:
	§§§ insert list

	</p>

<p>The 'p' elements including these additions have been marked with attribute
	@decls="#longversion", in this XML file, linking to the relevant
	'editorialDecl'.</p>



<div>
<head>Second hand in A</head>
<p>MS A, as mentioned above, has the 'short' version, and other parts that probably
were originally present in the codex were later lost due to physical damage.
Someone, probably in the XVII century, integrated MS A with the missing parts,
by writing them in the marginal space or by adding extra folios.
I transcribed and collated the following portions of MS A added by the second hand
and marked their readings with siglum 'a2' in 'app' elements:
g180.10-180.12, g180.13-180.15, g181.1-181.1, g181.2-181.5, g181.6-181.10, g181.10-181.11, 
81.12-182.19, g183.1-184.6, g184.7-184.9, g184.10-184.13, g186.6-186.7, g186.8-186.8, 
86.9-186.9, g187.5-187.8, g187.11-187.14, g188.5-188.7, g189.1-189.1, g191.3-191.5, 
95.6-195.8, g198.4-198.5, g198.12-198.13, g198.16-198.17, g199.5-199.8, g200.17-200.21, 
01.19-201.20, g202.7-202.10, g203.1-203.2, g203.6-203.6, g206.13-206.17, g208.1-208.9,

<head>Aim</head>
<p>The present edition aims at improving
the text of the Chronicon by Romualdus Salernitanus
(Romualdus II Guarna) through a new collation of the text
of the print editions of Garufi and Bonetti
against A and O, the main witnesses of the 'short version' of the work

<head>Paragraphs in O</head>
<p>Witness O (i.e. folios 16r-18v of Ottobon. Lat. 2940) has the following paragraphs:
g168.5-168.7, g168.8-169.4, g169.5-170.14, g170.15-170.16, g170.17-171.1, g171.2-171.6, 
71.7-171.8, g171.9-171.14, g172.1-172.9, g172.10-173.11, g173.12-173.13, g173.14-174.7, 
74.8-175.15, g176.1-176.2, g177.1-177.4, g177.5-177.6, g177.7-177.8, g177.9-178.3, 
78.4-178.10, g178.11-178.12, g178.13-179.2, g179.3-179.7, g179.8-179.9, g179.12-179.14, 
79.15-180.10, g180.10-180.12, g181.1-181.1, g181.2-181.5, g181.6-181.10, g181.10-181.11, 
81.12-182.19, g183.1-184.6, g184.7-184.9, g184.10-184.13, g184.13-185.7, g185.8-186.5.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Paragraphs in Garufi and Bonetti</head>
<p>I already mentioned
that portion of the work is included in Bonetti.
Garufi has the wole text, including the additions that distinuish the 'long'
from the 'short' version (though he mostly publishes those additions in apparatus notes),
but does not have the report of the Peace of Venice, i.e. paragraphs
from v-b298c through v-b306b. This is why their @xml:id does not start with 'g'.
Bonetti includes the Peace of Venice, with Arndt's text. [sbagliato, cambiare §]</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Paragraphs missing in A and O</head>
<p>Some paragraphs
are missing both in MS A (first or second hand) and in MS O,
so for them I am simply reporting the text of Garufi or Bonetti (i.e. Garufi/Arndt),
without any 'app' elements.
These paragraphs are those of the Peace of Venice, plus the following:
g74.21-74.21, g85.20-85.30, g85.31-86.12, g86.13-86.25, g86.26-87.29, g87.30-88.28, 
8.29-90.15, g90.16-90.20, g90.21-92.5, g92.6-92.7, g92.8-92.9, g179.10-179.11, 
86.10-186.11, g187.3-187.4, g199.13-199.15, g206.n4-206.n5, g215.n14-216.n10.</p>

<div>
<head>GitHub</head>
<p>The source code of this edition, including transcriptions of the
witnesses and Python software, is in the project GitHub repository
https://github.com/paolomonella/romualdus.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Collation exemplars</head>
<p>Garufi was the collation exemplar for the first part of the work,
from the incipit through paragraph g163.1-163.5. 
Bonetti was the collation exemplar for the part of the text
it includes, i.e. from paragraph g163.6-163.7 to the end of the text.
The legibility of the print in Bonetti's edition is better
than in Garufi's, so it lends itself to less error-prone OCR.
This is the reason why I decided to use Bonetti
as collation exemplar for this part of the work.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Bonetti</head>
<p>Bonetti uses Garufi's edition as "testo base",
and Arndt (Arndt, W., ed. 1866, Romoaldi II archiepiscopi Salernitani Annales,
Vol.  SS XIX, Hannover) as "elemento integrativo"
(see 'Nota al testo', Bonetti 2001, 56).
Thus Bonetti's text can be considered mostly equivalent to that of Garufi. 
However, in the part of the text collated against Bonetti
(g163.1-163.5 to the end), whenever I chose the reading of a MS against
that of Bonetti, and the text of Garufi diverged from that fo Bonetti,
I recorded both Garufi's and Bonetti's readings in the 'app' element.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Parts for collation</head>
<p>I transcribed A and O in TEI XML
using Garufi or Bonetti as noted above,
then performed an automatic collation of the transcriptions using
juxtacommons.org and edited the XML output files file manually.
I divided the text in four parts for collation:
<list>
	<item>for part '1' (incipit to g163.1-163.5), I collated Garufi against A;</item>
	<item>for part '2-alfa' (g163.6-163.7 through g167.4-168.4), Bonetti against A;</item>
	<item>for part '2-bravo' (g168.5-168.7 through g185.8-186.5), I collated Bonetti, A and O;</item>
	<item>for part '2-charlie' (g186.6-186.7 to the end), Bonetti against A.</item>
</list>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Transpositions</head>
<p>In part 2-bravo, the order of the paragraphs
diverges between Garufi, Bonetti and MS A, do to a number of large transpositions
of those paragraphs in the manuscripts.
I chose the order of Bonetti.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Transcription layers</head>
<p>I transcribed all witnesses
at the 'alphabetic layer', but I provided a sample
'graphematic layer' transcription of the first paragraphs of MSS A, B and C,
available in the edition GitHub repository.
See Monella 2018 (DOI: 10.6092/issn.2532-8816/7286) for a definition of
those layers of representation of the text in primary sources.
For paragraphs from g116.6-118.8 through g163.1-163.5 I only transcribed major variants.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Normalization</head>
<p>The OCR files of print editions
and the transcriptions of manuscripts have been marked
according to module '11 Representation of Primary Sources' of TEI P5.
Provided that quite surprisingly, there are yet no collation tools that compare
XML trees, i.e. that compare TEI transcriptions taking the markup into account,
I had to normalize the TEI transcriptions to prepare them for collation with
juxtacommons.org. I normalized transcriptions through custom Python scripts, which:
<list>
	<item>extracted an 'alphabetic' transcription from those
		paragraphs that had been transcribed 
		he graphematic layer;</item>
	<item>deleted the following tags with their textual content:
		'interp', 'abbr', 'surplus', 'note', 'milestone'.</item>
	<item>normalized numerals, e.g. 'xiiii' from MS A to 'XIV';</item>
	<item>introduced standard text for gaps in the MSS,
		e.g. {Gap in the MS: 1 illegible word};</item>
	<item>chose between 'sic'/'corr', 'reg'/'orig' elements;</item>
	<item>in particular, regularized 'j' to 'i' and 'v' to 'u'
		in all print and handwritten sources;</item>
	<item>capitalized proper nouns and words at the beginning
		of sentences also for MS text
		(e.g. 'pompeius' from MS A to 'Pompeius');</item>
	<item>stripped the markup for the following TEI tags
		(keeping their textual content, if any):
		'rs', 'hi', 'w', 'choice', 'orig', 'reg', 'num',
		'subst', 'add', 'del', 'expan', 'sic', 'seg',
		'lb', 'pb', 'quote', 'title', 'said', 'soCalled',
		'surplus', 'supplied', 'gap', 'l';</item>
	<item>replaced XML angle brackets with [square brackets]
		for 'p' start- and end-tags, thus producing an output
		such as [p xml:id="g3.2-3.6"]: another script then
		restored the angle brackets in the output
		of the juxtacommons.org collation;</item>
</list>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Variant types and subtypes</head>
<p>I added a @type attribute
to all 'app' elements, and a @subtype attribute to some.
Custom Python scripts proposed the values of those attributes,
then I reviewed them all manually.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>List of variant types</head>
<p>Attribute @type
of 'app' can take one of the following values:
<list>
	<item>'substantive'</item>
	<item>'orthographic'</item>
	<item>'punctuation'</item>
	<item>'gap-in-ms'</item>
	<item>'illegible-in-ms'</item>
	<item>'transposition'</item>
</list>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Variant subtypes</head>
<p>In combination with each @type,
@subtype can take one of the following values:
<list>
	<item>In combination with @type='substantive',
		@subtype (if present) can be:
		'missing-in-print', 'num-num', 'missing-in-ms',
		'transposition', 'fs';</item>
	<item>In combination with @type='orthographic':
		'y' (e.g. martirio/martyrio), 'v', 'j', 'ae',
		'h' (e.g. hodie/odie), 'n-pn', 'hi-y',
		'num-word' (e.g. III/tria), 'case',
		'tc' (e.g. iustitia/iusticia),
		'double' (e.g.  successit/succesit),
		'ph', 'cq', 'mpn', 'tz', 'cz', 'ck',
		'word-segmentation', 'ch', 
		', 'dm-mm', 'mn', 'ncx';</item>
	<item>In combination with @type="punctuation":
		"change-punctuation", "add-punctuation",
		"remove-punctuation".</item>
</list>
</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Variants for which many subtypes apply</head>
<p>For some variants
(i.e. for some 'app' elements), it is impossible
to determine one subtype, either because two subtypes apply
(e.g., for Symmachus/Simachus 'y' and 'double')
or because there are three readings with different types and/or subtypes
(e.g.  Pisa, Bonetti / Pysas, MS A / Pisas, MS O: Pisa/Pysas is 
ubstantive' variant, but Pysas/Pisas is an 'orthographic'/'y' variant).
I took a pragmatic (and certainly debatable) approach to this issue,
as I chose what I thought was the most relevant type/subtype:
for example, I chose subtype 'y' for Symmachus/Simachus
and type 'substantive' for Pisa/Pysas/Pisas.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Distinction between substantive and orthographic</head>
<p>Also, the line
between 'substantive' and 'orthographic' variants is thin.
This is particularly evident for proper nouns, for which the change of one
letter can be considered meaningful. This is why for proper nouns I tended
to choose @type='substantive', except for the most common orthographic
subtypes, such as 'double' (Callixtus/Calixtus), 'y' (Babyloniam/Babiloniam)
or 'h' (Hieronymo/Ieronimo).</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Case variants</head>
<p>Some 'app' elements mark a distinction between
the lowercase and capitalized spelling of the same word:
these elements have @type="orthographic" with @subtype="case".
For example, 'Cainan' (my lemma) vs cainan (reading of Garufi and of MS A).
MSS will always have the lowercase spelling by convention,
because capitalization does not have graphematic value in them.
Those 'app' elements mean that I capitalize a word that was in lowercase
in the print edition, or vice versa.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Punctuation variants</head>
<p>The case of punctuation is similar to the preceding one.
I chose not to transcribe the MSS punctuation, so all 'app'
elements with type="punctuation" mean that I am modifying
the punctuation of the print edition (of the collation exemplar
for that part of the text). For example, I deleted all
quotation marks from the Bonetti edition, but sometimes
punctuation modification implies significant differences
in phrase and sentence segmentation, therefore in syntax
and text interpretation.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Orthography variants</head>
<p>In orthographic variants
(i.e. 'app' elements with type="orthography), I generally tended
not to modify the print edition spelling. I did modify it,
mostly by adopting MS A's spelling, in cases in which 
<list>
	<item>the print edition has an evident typo, which the MS
		does not have (e.g. 'eorem' Garufi / 'eorum MS A
		in g26.12-26.23);</item>
	<item>the MS's form clearly is more standard both in classical 
		dieval Latin and, most of all, more adherent
		to the usus scribendi of the rest of the work
		(e.g. 'espers' in Garufi / 'expers' in A,
		or omicidia G / homicidia A);</item>
	<item>the print edition has a classical diphthong ('ae' or 'oe')
		while the MS has the monophthongized spelling, which
		I preferred, since monophthongized forms are standard
		in the text. For example, in g70.1-70.19 I chose
		A's 'Rome' over Garufi's 'Romae'. This is a sub-case
		of the previous principle, and in 'ae'/'e' variants
		it is marked with @subtype='ae';</item>
	<item>I eliminated a dash distinguishing a composed word
		in the print edition (e.g. in g80.1-80.4 I chose spelling
		'Primiscrinium' over 'Primi-scrinium' of Garufi).</item>
</list>
</p>
</div>

<div>§ metti da qualche parte 'factual' / subst readings,
	e che per i fatti mi sono appoggiato alle print editions,
	lavoro da storici, io ho visto usus scribendi; aim: migliorare
	testo su base di nuova collaz. di O e soprattutto A</div>
