5		̾	Abbreviation mark	"Shaped like a little ""s"", its lower part goes left. It is written above the base grapheme (it might be an allograph of ""2""). Alternative options for visualization are  ᷤ (U+1DE4) or   ̾ (U+033E), which is the best one, though some browsers might not visualize it correctly. Character  ̉ (U+0309, the simplest one) is not suitable because it looks more like the ""w"" abbreviation."	
9		;	Abbreviation mark	"It looks like a modern semicolon (;), written on the right of a final letter (mostly ""q;"" for ""que"" and ""b;"" for ""bus""). There is a Unicode character  U+F1AC (LATIN ABBREVIATION SIGN SEMICOLON), but it is not correctly visualized on my system (it is in the private use area). Also, I’m using this only for visualization"
